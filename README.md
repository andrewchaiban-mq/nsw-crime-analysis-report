# Do the economic factors of an LGA impact crime?

Our project aims to analyse and compare criminal data in Sydney and investigate a relationship with key factors such as income data in corresponding areas of Sydney and NSW. 
Through our analysis we are aiming to find a relationship between key income statistics such as average household income and education, and correlate this to crime committed in that area. By closely analysing relationships between these economic factors and the crimes committed we intend to draw informed conclusions.

This project includes the following:

* Crime data exploration and visualisation
* K-means clustering analysis of crime across NSW LGAs
* Regression analysis of crime and socio-econimic factors

*This project was completed in Semester 2 2021 at Macquarie University for COMP2200 - Data Science.*
